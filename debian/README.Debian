The pip command from the python-pip package should be used to install
applications in the environment created by virtualenv.

The Virtualenv sources tarball provides the eggs for setuptools 2.4,2.5,2.6
and tarballs of the pip project and distribute project. When no internet 
connection is available, these files are required in order to setup
properly the environments. Otherwise virtualenv attempts to download them.
